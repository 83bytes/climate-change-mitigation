This page is a non-exhaustive list of interesting subject areas for
folks who, like me, are interested in both computer science and
environmental sustainability. It aims to provide an (incomplete) answer
to the question: How can a computer scientist contribute measurable
improvements to our environmental sustainability?

Good overviews are provided by:

about climate change?]"

Below is a list of topics:


== Buildings


* Smart meter disaggregation: estimate an itemised energy bill from a
single smart meter. Not clear how much energy this would save across the
entire population though.
* "Intelligent" heating controls - try to only heat the rooms which are
occupied; and only do so when the house is occupied.
* Never-mind "smart" heating controls, just a concerted effort to make
'bog standard' heating controls more user-friendly would probably go a
long way towards helping. How about an open-source, well designed
controller that makes it really easy to understand what's going on.
* Modelling the energy usage of buildings (e.g. see
https://teddinet.org/2016/03/23/special-section-of-energy-buildings-advances-in-building-energy-modeling-and-simulation/[this
special section in the journal Energy & Buildings on 'Advances in
Building Energy Modeling and Simulation'])
* Demand response


=== Commercial / industrial buildings

* Football pitches heat the grass to optimise the growth rate. Existing
pitches have very primitive controls.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283510972_Energy_Efficiency_Gains_in_Daily_Grass_Heating_Operation_of_Sports_Facilities_through_Supervisory_Holistic_Control[NEC
presented work on this topic at BuildSys2015]
* Analyse and present data on the behaviour of appliances in large
buildings; hence allowing building managers to reduce energy consumption
(companies already doing this include
http://www.demandlogic.co.uk[Demand Logic],
https://www.energydeck.com[energyDECK], http://verdigris.co[VERDIGRIS]).


== Transport

* Computer-controlled rigid sails on cargo ships (can save up to 20% of
fuel, apparently) (see
http://www.bluebird-electric.net/wind_powered_ships_marine_renewable_energy_research.htm[Bluebird-Electric]
and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzGCYaJbf0A[this video] and the
wikipedia page on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill_ship[Windmill
ships].)


== Making computer systems more efficient


=== Individual machines

* Energy efficient OS scheduling (e.g. tinkering with the Linux kernel
scheduler; although it appears that the Linux scheduler has been very
good at minimising energy usage since at least 2.6.38)


=== Data centres

* Teach Hadoop how to put nodes to sleep
(https://www.zotero.org/jack_kelly/items/collectionKey/ECEHDVKX[here's a
list of papers on the topic])
* Use large computational-fluid-dynamics to model air flow through an
entire data centre to optimise the cooling system. IBM have done work on
this: http://sensys.acm.org/2015/keynote/#hendrik[Dr Hamann from IBM
spoke about this at SenSys 2015].


== Energy production

=== Wind power

* Using machine learning to optimise wind turbine pitch angle (e.g.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.02.014[Yalmaz & Ã–zer, 2009])
* Do a better job of modelling wind wake from turbines to optimise
placement of individual turbines in a wind farm.


=== Fossil fuel generation

* Optimising fossil-fuel fired electricity generation (e.g.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2008.10.038[Fengqi et al 2009])


=== Solar power

* Solar tracking for solar farms
* Predicting output of wind and solar farms - e.g. using video camera
with a fish-eye lens looking up at the sky to predict when cloud cover
will pass over a solar array - even being able to predict power output a
few minutes into the future can help the grid to respond -

about this at SenSys 2015].


== Agriculture

* Efficient and adaptive water management - IBM have done work on using
aerial photography to detect dry ground in a vineyard and then control
water distribution to target the driest parts of the vineyard:

about this at SenSys 2015].


== Detecting environmental change

* Google Earth Engine is "__a planetary-scale platform for Earth science
& data analysis - Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog
of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale
analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists,
researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify
differences on the Earth's surface.__" One use-case was
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth_Engine#Deforestation[detecting
deforestation in "near real time"].


== Climate science

* Analysing today's climate and forecasting future climates is very,
very compute-intensive.
